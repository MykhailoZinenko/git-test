- Resource management (Food, Materials, Energy, Water, etc.)
- Building construction system
- Population and worker management
- Turn-based gameplay with different phases
- Planet types with varying characteristics

## Game Mechanics
- **Colonization**: Expand your colony by colonizing adjacent tiles
- **Construction**: Build different structures to sustain your colony
- **Resources**: Manage production and consumption of various resources
- **Workers**: Assign colonists to operate buildings efficiently

4. Construct buildings to produce resources and house colonists
5. Manage your resources carefully to ensure colony growth

## Building Types
- **Production Buildings**: Generate resources (Farm, Mine, Solar Array)
- **Habitation Buildings**: House your colonists (Habitat Dome, Residential Complex)
- **Advanced Facilities**: Specialized buildings for research and rare resources

## Development
This project is built with Java using JavaFX for the user interface. It follows object-oriented design principles with a focus on extensibility.

## Requirements
